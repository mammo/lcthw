# Learn C The Hard Way

Nothing to see here, please move on. This repo is mostly to allow me to move code between computers as I read [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book). Making this public also gives an accountability bonus, should that be needed.

If you have read this far, you must be curious. I started playing with C when I was 15, but it never became my primary language. I haven't touched it since the late 90's except for fixing minor issues in existing code. As a former (well, now I'm back) Linux user, C was hard to avoid. I ran into Learn C The Hard Way a week or so ago and it made me nostalgic and I started coding a little.
